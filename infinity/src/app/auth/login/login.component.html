          This game is a remaster of the 1972 pong, the original concept of Pong
          is a two-dimensional sports game that simulate table tennis. Two
          players controls an in-game white paddle on a black background, while
          a ball is represented by a small white square, moves through the
          screen and bounces off the top and bottom edges. The player moves his
          paddle by sliding it vertically using mouse or pad. Players use the
          paddle to hit a ball back and forth. The speed of the ball increases
          at every hit of a player. The ball's rebound angle changes depending
          where it hits the paddle. The goal for the players :
          <strong>be the first to reach 11 points</strong>. <br />
          In addition, we have a ranking system accompanied by a matchmaking to
          delight our most competitive players.
